            <h3>The Meaning of Guushu 谷序</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                "Gu" (谷) represents valley - symbolizing depth, wisdom, and the gathering of diverse elements. "Shu" (序) means sequence or order - representing the harmonious arrangement of these elements through time.
                Together, Guushu embodies the concept of fashion as a flowing sequence through the valleys of time, where contemporary trends meet timeless elegance, creating pieces that transcend seasonal boundaries.
